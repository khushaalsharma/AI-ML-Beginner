# AI-ML-Beginner
Two types of AI - weak and strong
Weak : designed and trained for specific tasks like Siri, Alexa, etc
Strong AI: Also called Artificial General Intellgence, have the ability to exhibit human level intelligence with adaptibility to different domains

Alan Turing proposed a way called a Turing Test, which also acts like a definition of intelligence. The test compares a given system to something inherently intelligent - a real human being, and because any automatic comparison can be bypassed by a computer program, we use a human interrogator. So, if a human being is unable to distinguish between a real person and a computer system in text-based dialogue - the system is considered intelligent.

Different approaches to AI - Top down(Symbolic Reasoning) and Bottom Up(Neural Networks)

In Top Down - we model how humans solve a problem ie extracting knowledge and presenting it in computer readable form
In Bottom Up - we model how human brain works, consisting of units(neurons) which can be trained together in data to solve problems
Other approaches - Multi-agent Evolutionary or genetic
