Two types of AI - weak and strong
Weak : designed and trained for specific tasks like Siri, Alexa, etc
Strong AI: Also called Artificial General Intellgence, have the ability to exhibit human level intelligence with adaptibility to different domains

Alan Turing proposed a way called a Turing Test, which also acts like a definition of intelligence. The test compares a given system to something inherently intelligent - a real human being, and because any automatic comparison can be bypassed by a computer program, we use a human interrogator. So, if a human being is unable to distinguish between a real person and a computer system in text-based dialogue - the system is considered intelligent.

Different approaches to AI - Top down(Symbolic Reasoning) and Bottom Up(Neural Networks)

In Top Down - we model how humans solve a problem ie extracting knowledge and presenting it in computer readable form
In Bottom Up - we model how human brain works, consisting of units(neurons) which can be trained together in data to solve problems
Other approaches - Multi-agent Evolutionary or genetic

Top Down approach is based on two big ideas: Knowledge representation and Reasoning
We align knowledge concept to DIKW Pyramid(Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom)
Data - Physical media(text, spoken words, etc)
Information - how we interpret data in our head
Knowledge - info that is being integrated into world model
Wisdom - represents meta knowledge

Left side has computable aspects of knowledge representation such as algorithms, semantic rules, production rules, etc
Right side has representation of knowledge in natural text, cannot be used for automatic reasoning
