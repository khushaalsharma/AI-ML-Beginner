numpy - numerical python -> backbone of data science, ML and other fields
Numpy is used over pure python as helps in doing complex calculations in shorter time as compared to pure python, bcoz of opt in C
uses vectorization via broadcasting ie avoiding writing loops

Main data type which is most oftenly used from the numpy library is - ndarray ( n dimensional array)
its attributes: 
1) shape -> shows the dimensions of the array
2) ndim -> shows the no. of dimensions
3) dtype -> shows the data type of elements in the aaray
4) size -> total no. of elements in the array

normal function (not a member):
type -> shows the type of array ie ndarray or numpy.ndarray

-> as pandas is built over numpy thus we can use ndarray to create a DataFrame coindition taht ndarray ndimhas to be 2
