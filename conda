Conda is a powerful command line tool for package
It is a package manager that manages all packages in the software distributor(anaconda or miniconda)
Anaconda contains all the libraries which are made till now for machine learning (3GB space)
Mini Conda contains only selected libraries which are needed to begin developing a model (200 MB space)

Conda gives the ability to create the environments for the projects
Creating a conda env:
way 1: conda create --prefix ./env {name ofpackages}
To activate this environment
 $ conda activate "{folder location of env for the particular project}"
eg: $ conda activate "C:\Users\Khushaal-Sharma\Desktop\ML\sample_project_1\env"
On writing this command, base prompt will change to the local environment prompt ie the location of project file

way 2: conda create -n env python={version of python you need} {package names}

to activate this environment
conda activate env

To deactivate an active environment,
 $ conda deactivate

To install a new package/library in the active environment we use,
 conda install {package_name}

Once the local env is activated on writing jupyter notebook cmd -> it will open a jupyter notebook on the default browser
Jupyter notebooks are saved with extension - .ipynb
