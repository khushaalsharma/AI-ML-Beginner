Scikit learn is the industry standard library for machine learning

-> built on numpy and matplotlib
-> very well designed API
-> in built machine learning models
-> methods to evaluate machine learning models

Scikit Learning Workflow:
1) Getting the data ready
2) Choosing the right estimator/algorithm for our problem
3) Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
4) Evaluating the model
5) improving the model
6) save and load a trained model
7) putting it all together
