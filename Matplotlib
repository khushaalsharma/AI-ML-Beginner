It is a python library that helps in visual representation of this data from numpy and pandas
matplotlib.pyplot -> python's equivalent to MATLAB

plt.plot() -> creates the canvas/figure for the plot(graph)

GENERAL WORKFLOW OF MATPLOTLIB
#0. import matplotlib and get it ready for ploting jupyter
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#1. Prepare data
x = [1,2,3,4]
y = [11,22,33,44]

#2. setup plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10)) # height and width of plot

#3 plot the data
ax.plot(x, y)

#4. customise the plot
ax.set(title="Simple Plot",
       xlabel="x-axis",
       ylabel="y axis")

#4. save and share
fig.savefig("Numpy Images/sample-plot.png")

types of plots in Matplotlib.pyplot -> line, scatter(dot), bar, histogram, subplots

ax is the axes for the figure made using plt.subplots()
for scatter plot -> ax.scatter() -> various attributes
for bar plot -> ax.bar() first arg is the values for x axis and 2nd arg is for height against each value on x axis
for horizontal bar plot -> ax.barh() -> y and width as mandatory arg, sent as list
for histograms-> ax.hist()
for subplots (ie more than one plots at a time) -> 
       There are two ways to subplot
              1) Plotting various subplots as fig ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2) -> this will create 4 plots within a figure
                     we can change the number of plots according to our wish by changing the nrows, ncols values and no. of axes
              2)
